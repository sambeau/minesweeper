# Minesweeper

A small minesweeper cloan I created for my portfolio. It does all the usual things a minesweeper does.

It's written in React and wrapped in Remix.

The code is reasonably clean and it's well documented. It's in apps/components/minsweeper component and all the tricky logic is in the board component.
