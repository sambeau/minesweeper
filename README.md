# Minesweeper

A small minesweeper clone I created for my portfolio. It does all the usual things a minesweeper does (except '?' tiles, as I don't like those).

It's written in React and wrapped in Remix. It has one dependency usehooks-ts which I din't use as much as I expected, so I'll probably remove.

The code is reasonably clean and it's well documented. It's in apps/components/minsweeper component and all the tricky logic is in the board component.
